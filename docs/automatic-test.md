# Automatic Sync Test

This file was created to test if the Claude assets sync hook triggers automatically.

**Test Details:**
- Created at: 2025-09-01 23:57:00
- File location: ~/.claude/docs/automatic-test.md
- Expected: Hook should detect this Write operation and sync to GitHub

**What should happen:**
1. Hook receives PostToolUse event
2. Detects file path is in watched directory
3. Triggers sync process
4. Files get committed and pushed to GitHub repo

Let's see if this works automatically!
