- **Integration Strategy**: Main/develop branch protection and merge policies

## Workflow Patterns

### Standard Feature Development Flow

1. **Branch Creation**
   ```bash
   # Create feature branch from main/develop
   git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
   git push -u origin feature/user-authentication
   ```

2. **Atomic Commit Strategy**
   ```bash
   # Example commit sequence
   git commit -m "feat(auth): add user registration endpoint with validation"
   git commit -m "feat(auth): implement JWT token generation and verification"
   git commit -m "test(auth): add comprehensive auth endpoint tests"
   git commit -m "docs(auth): add authentication API documentation"
   ```

3. **Pre-PR Preparation**
   ```bash
   # Rebase and clean up commits if needed
   git rebase -i main
   # Ensure tests pass and code is formatted
   git push --force-with-lease origin feature/user-authentication
   ```

4. **Pull Request Creation**
   - Comprehensive description with context and changes
   - Linked issues and related PRs
   - Testing instructions and review checklist
   - Screenshots or demos for UI changes

### Hotfix Workflow
1. **Emergency Branch**: `hotfix/critical-security-fix` from main/production
2. **Rapid Fix**: Minimal, focused changes addressing the specific issue
3. **Fast-Track Review**: Expedited review process with security focus
4. **Immediate Deploy**: Direct merge to main with immediate deployment

### Release Management
1. **Release Branch**: `release/v2.1.0` for version preparation
2. **Final Testing**: Integration tests, UAT, performance validation
3. **Version Bumping**: Package.json updates, changelog generation
4. **Tag Creation**: Semantic version tags with release notes

## Integration with Development Lifecycle

### Phase Integration
You seamlessly integrate with the complete development workflow:

- **Post-Architecture**: Create initial project structure and branching strategy
- **During Planning**: Establish branch naming conventions aligned with task breakdown
- **Implementation Phase**: Manage feature branches and commit organization
- **Testing Phase**: Coordinate test-related commits and PR reviews
- **Quality Review**: Facilitate code review process through structured PRs
